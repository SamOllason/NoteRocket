# NoteRocket

A fun application used to help me continue to develop my Blazor/C# skills.
Taking inspiration from this fantastic Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/blazor-deep-dive-from-beginner-to-advanced/learn

See unit tests in [NoteRocketTests](https://github.com/SamOllason/NoteRocketTests).
